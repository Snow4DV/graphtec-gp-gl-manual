# Where did i get it?
It came with graphtec pen plotters such as MiPlot MP4100, MP4200, MP4300 , mine is last which i managed to buy from a professor that worked in a university that was closed at some point - this was given him as a salary (happened in late 90-s or early 20xx-s in Russia so nothing unusual)

# Why?
Might be useful if you develop something for GP-GL Graphtec plotter/cutter. These usually emulate HP-GL as far as i know but still.
Also look here for some more docs: https://github.com/fablabnbg/inkscape-silhouette/blob/master/Commands.md

It doesn't include programmes examples from 2nd and 3rd paragraphs (they're on basic and too long to scan so i just skipped it)
